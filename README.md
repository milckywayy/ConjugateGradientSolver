# ConjugateGradientSolver
The "Conjugate Gradient Solver" project is a Java application designed to solve systems of linear equations using the Conjugate Gradient method.  

The Conjugate Gradient method is an effective numerical technique for solving sparse and large systems of linear equations. It allows finding an approximate solution in a finite number of iterations.
